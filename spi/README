Hardware
--------
Broadcom BCM2835 includes three SPI controllers.
One of the controllers (SPI0) is available on the
GPIO header P1 according to (ModelB):

MOSI (Pin19)  Master Out Slave In
MISO (Pin21)  Master In Slave Out
CLK  (Pin23)  Clock
CE0  (Pin24)  Chip select #0
CE1  (Pin26)  Chip select #1

The controller has three independent chip selects.
Two of them are available on the header (CE0, CE1).

For further information, see BCM 2835 ARM Peripherals.

Linux kernel
------------
The Linux kernel includes two drivers for SPI:
1) spi-bcm2708.ko (Controller driver, hardware specific)
2) spidev.ko      (Protocol driver, generic)

Kernel source code for Controller driver:
../drivers/spi/spi-bcm2708.c

The protocol driver has a character device interface:
/dev/spidevB.C	    (B=Bus, C=Chip select)
/dev/spidev0.0      (Chip select #0)
/dev/spidev0.1      (Chip select #1)

Activating the drivers
----------------------
To ensure that the drivers are loaded at boot, they
need to be removed from the blacklist:
/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf

Alternatively, the drivers can be loaded manually:
> modprobe spi-bcm2708
> modprobe spidev

User space API
--------------
#include <linux/spi/spidev.h>

* Use open() and close() on /dev/spidevB.C.
* Several ioctl() requests are available.
* SPI transfers are represented using the 
  struct spi_ioc_transfer.
