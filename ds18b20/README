DS18B20 (Maxim) is a digital temperature sensor with 1-Wire interface.
The 1-Wire bus system was designed by Dallas Semiconductor Corp.
This bus is similar in concept as I2C, but with lower data rates and
with longer ranges.

Connect to connector P1 according to figure below.

P1-06 (GND)   ------------------------  GND
P1-01 (3.3V)  ------------------------  VDD
                    |
                   ---
                   | | 4.7k (pull-up)
                   ---
                    |
P1-07 (GPIO4) ------------------------  DQ (Data)

Add 1-Wire support:

1) Add the following line to /boot/config.txt
   dtoverlay=w1-gpio

2) Add the following lines to /etc/modules
   w1-gpio
   w1-therm

The device tree overlay is using GPIO4 as default.
This pin can be changed according to:
dtoverlay=w1-gpio,gpiopin=<value>

For further information, see /boot/overlays/README.

-- Read temperature from sensor --
----------------------------------
The sensor is accessed from the file system:
/sys/bus/w1/devices/28-xxxxxxxxxx/w1_slave

Each sensor (28-) will have an unique serial number (xxxxx).
Plug one in at a time, look what file is created and label sensor.
Get temperature from a sensor by reading the corresponding file.

cat /sys/bus/w1/devices/28-0215535bfbff/w1_slave
38 01 80 80 1f ff 80 80 19 : crc=19 YES
38 01 80 80 1f ff 80 80 19 t=19500

Response from read operation consists of two lines of text.
* The first line will have YES or NO at the end.
  YES means checksum is ok and that the temperature value is valid.
* The second line ends with the temperature in 1/1000 deg C.

According to datasheet (Maxim), conversion time using 12-bit
resolution is 750ms. Timing read operation in a shell gave 830ms.
This is relative slow, but seems to be hardcoded in kernel module (w1_therm.c).
